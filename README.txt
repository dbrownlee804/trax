Trax is a minimal GPS application for the Pebble Time smartwatch.


FEATURES
- Operates hands-free on your wrist - no need to interrupt your outdoor zen by checking your phone.
- Your location is reported in meaningful 1m metric grid USNG co-ordinates.
- Your path taken is mapped out graphically with breadcrumbs.


CONTEXT
The Pebble Trax software was composed in partial fulfillment of a M. Eng. (Software) degree at École de technologie supérieure (Montréal).


CONSTRAINTS
As a master's mini-thesis project, time was an huge constraint.  All aspects of development were intended to take 135 hours, or roughly the equivalent of one month's work, full-time.

The main focus was on maximizing the utility of Pebble's small, 1.25 inch, 64 colour, 144 x 168 pixel screen.  This represents ~2-3% the real estate of a contemporary smartphone.

For rapidity, Trax was coded in JavaScript against the Pebble.js framework.  This framework had stability and performance issues and was only intended for application prototyping.  While more stable, coding in Pebble's native C would have been prohibitively lengthy.


AFTERWORD
On December 7, 2016, Pebble was purchased by Fitbit and announced that all hardware manufacturing and support would be discontinued.
